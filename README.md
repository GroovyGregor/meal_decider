# meal_decider

Have you ever been sitting at home, not able to decide what to eat to lunch?
Consider yourself lucky - the meal decider is here!
Based on a list of meals together with a health rating, taste_rating and the
type of meal (vegan, vegetarian, meat), the script suggests your next meal.
This can be one of your listed meals, but the program might also suggest you
go and try to make a new meal.

To run the script you need to rate the taste of all your meals in the file
'taste_rating.csv'. For the same meals, a health rating (health_rating.csv) as
well as the type of meal (meal_type.csv) needs to be provided.
Example files can be seen in this repository.

If you've provided the input files - simply run the script 'meal_decider.py'
using python3 and voil√†: your next meal is decided.
